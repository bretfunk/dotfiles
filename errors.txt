Node

Errors about mismatched versions happened when I had node installed outside of nvim.
I brew uninstalled node and then reinstalled nvm and nvm install --lts and the errors went away
Also added text to the bashrc 

Python

Same as the node errors, too many python version on the computer and different programs were going to the wrong versions.
Especially neovim.  I uninstalled all python versions I could find then reinstalled pyenv.  That fixed it.
I also uninstalled a bunch of unused nvm versions and reset the global version to a newer one.
